# @ai-translate/provider-ai-sdk

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`18f220e`](https://github.com/thiagoperes/ai-translate/commit/18f220e63f5ce99ffa4197d52dfc28b396fdd2fc) Thanks [@thiagoperes](https://github.com/thiagoperes)! - Make the model vendor a choice rather than a dependency.

  The translation and semantic-audit engine — prompt assembly, batching, key
  aliasing, response decoding, the repair loop, self-check attestation — now
  lives in `@ai-translate/provider-core` and talks to exactly one vendor
  interface, `StructuredCompletionTransport.complete`.

  `@ai-translate/provider-openai` keeps its API and becomes a thin transport over
  that engine. The new `@ai-translate/provider-ai-sdk` is a second transport over
  the same engine, so any AI SDK model works — Anthropic, Google, Bedrock, Groq,
  xAI, a gateway, or a local model — for both translation and semantic audits:

  ```ts
  import { anthropic } from "@ai-sdk/anthropic";
  import { createAiSdkTranslationProvider } from "@ai-translate/provider-ai-sdk";

  provider: createAiSdkTranslationProvider({
    model: anthropic("claude-sonnet-4"),
  });
  ```

  `ai-translate init` can generate either wiring: `--provider ai-sdk`,
  `--provider-package @ai-sdk/anthropic`, and `--model <id>` pick the provider
  package, the vendor factory, and the model written into the config.

  The output contract material is now a vendor-neutral JSON Schema rather than an
  OpenAI response format object, so the translation and semantic-audit contract
  revisions change and previously accepted translations are re-verified on the
  next sync. Semantic audits also gained the wall-clock deadline the translation
  path already had, so a transport that ignores its own timeout can no longer
  hang a run.

  Both provider packages require Node 22 or newer, matching the `openai` and `ai`
  SDKs they wrap. Everything else still runs on Node 20.19.
